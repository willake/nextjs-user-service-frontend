This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Version Control
This project follows [GitFlow](http://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html) version control rules, but not that strict.

Hereby a brief guide:

- For the `main` branch, you cannot push commits into it directly. It can only be merged from any `release` branch with a pull request. We need to make sure that every version of the `main` branch is the latest production-ready game.
- For the `develop` branch, you cannot push commits into it directly. It can only be merged from any `feature/xxx_xxx` branch with a pull request. We need to make sure that every version of the `develop` branch is a runnable game.
- If you want to add a new feature or maybe refactor any code structure, **you should create a branch named `feature/the_name_of_feature` from the develop branch.** When the branch is finished, you can create a pull request for updating the `develop` branch.
- When a `develop` branch is ready to be published, you can create a pull request to create a `release/vx.x.x` branch. The name of a branch could be `release/v0.0.1` or `release/alpha1`.
